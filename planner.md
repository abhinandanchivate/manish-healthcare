Below is the revised **12-Week HLS Fresher Training Planner** as per client guidelines starting from **8th July 2025**, with Indian national holidays considered.

Each training day will consist of **4 sessions**:

* **Sessions 1–3**: Theory, Discussions, Case Studies
* **Session 4**: Hands-on Practical + Daily MCQs/Assessment

The selected projects for continuity across case studies will be:
**1. FHIR-Powered Patient Portal with HL7 Message Parsing** – enabling learners to design, implement, and simulate the entire flow from HL7 message ingestion to FHIR-compliant patient dashboards.
**2. Clinical Document Viewer: CDA and FHIR Hybrid Dashboard** – guiding learners to build a unified viewer that integrates CDA documents with FHIR APIs for clinical decision-making workflows.
