## üè• Student Manual ‚Äì Phase 1: Healthcare Data and Interoperability

### üìò Module Overview

This phase provides a comprehensive understanding of healthcare data exchange standards, interoperability mechanisms, and practical hands-on experience. Students will explore HL7 (v2 & FHIR), clinical document architecture, medical imaging standards, and the integration ecosystem through APIs and messaging protocols.

---

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, students should be able to:

* Explain the role and structure of HL7 v2 and HL7 FHIR in healthcare data exchange.
* Understand FHIR resources, extensions, and profiling.
* Describe levels of interoperability (technical, semantic, process).
* Demonstrate integration techniques using APIs and message parsers.
* Work with standards like CDA, DICOM, and USCDI.
