| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Stands for**       | Test-Driven Development                  | Behavior-Driven Development                     |
| **Primary Focus**    | Code functionality (How it works)        | User behavior and business rules (What it does) |
| **Audience**         | Developers                               | Devs, QA, Business Analysts                     |
| **Language**         | Programming/Test language (e.g., Python) | Natural language (e.g., Gherkin)                |
| **Test Type**        | Unit tests                               | Acceptance/Integration tests                    |
| **Tools**            | JUnit, pytest, unittest, Mocha           | Cucumber, Behave, SpecFlow, Cypress+Cucumber    |
| **Test Format**      | assert-style (technical)                 | Given-When-Then (readable)                      |
| **Design Influence** | Code design via refactoring              | Feature design via user behavior                |


| **Aspect**                       | **What TDD Does**                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧪 **Starts with Tests**         | Forces you to write a test first for a small unit of functionality.                |
| 🚧 **Guides Design**             | Helps define what the code **should do** before writing the actual implementation. |
| ♻️ **Supports Refactoring**      | With tests in place, you can safely refactor without breaking functionality.       |
| 🐞 **Reduces Bugs**              | Prevents defects by testing every unit from the beginning.                         |
| 🔍 **Improves Clarity**          | Helps clarify requirements and edge cases early.                                   |
| 📈 **Boosts Confidence**         | Developers feel more confident deploying because tests validate behavior.          |
| 📊 **Enables Regression Checks** | Makes sure changes don't break existing code (regression testing).                 |
