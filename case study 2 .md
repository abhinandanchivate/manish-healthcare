# 🏥 **FHIR-Powered Patient Portal with HL7 Message Parsing**

**Generic Microservices-Based Case Study Document**

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

This document presents a platform-agnostic, modular architecture for building a **FHIR-compliant patient portal** capable of **HL7 message ingestion and transformation**. The architecture leverages **microservices principles** to ensure flexibility, scalability, and maintainability across different health IT ecosystems.

This patient portal supports secure access to medical records, HL7 to FHIR data conversion, and integrates with external systems such as hospital EMRs, labs, and national health registries.

## **6. Workflow: HL7 to FHIR Message Flow**

1. External LIS/EMR system sends HL7 v2 message (e.g., ORU^R01 lab result)
2. HL7 Ingestor Service receives message via TCP/MLLP or REST
3. HL7 Parser converts message to intermediate JSON structure
4. FHIR Transformer maps parsed structure to appropriate FHIR resources
5. FHIR Store API persists data into the system
6. Notification Service alerts patient about new data availability
7. Patient accesses portal and views structured records in a FHIR-compatible UI
