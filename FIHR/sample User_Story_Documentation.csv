hl7-parser-service,"As a system, I want to receive HL7 v2 messages (ADT, ORU, ORM) over MLLP and HTTP.","The system listens for incoming HL7 messages which are sent by hospital systems for patient registration (ADT), lab orders (ORM), and results (ORU). These come over MLLP (a TCP-based protocol) or HTTP POST.",Hospital System ➝ HL7-Parser (MLLP/HTTP) ➝ Kafka Topic: hl7.raw.inbound,Raw HL7 Message ➝ HL7 Segment Parser ➝ FHIR Mapper ➝ JSON ➝ Kafka Topic: hl7.fhir.outbound,"Think of this as receiving a letter from a hospital in a specific language (HL7). We read it, translate it to a universal format (FHIR JSON), and share it with other systems.",HL7 Sender → [HL7 Parser] → [Kafka] → [Other Services]
patient-service,"As a patient, I want to register with my demographic and insurance details.","The portal allows a patient to enter their personal info (name, DOB, gender, contact) and insurance provider details. This gets stored in the system and linked to their patient ID (MRN).",UI Form → patient-service API → MongoDB → Kafka Topic: patient.created,Form Input ➝ FHIR Patient Resource ➝ DB ➝ Notification Event,Imagine you're signing up on a website with your name and health insurance. That data gets saved and shared with other systems like billing or appointments.,Patient UI → [Register API] → [FHIR Patient DB] → [Kafka Event]
observation-service,"As a system, I want to ingest lab results using HL7 ORU^R01 and convert them to FHIR Observation resources.","Lab results sent via HL7 are parsed and each test result (e.g. blood glucose, cholesterol) is saved as a FHIR Observation resource.",Lab System → HL7 Message → HL7 Parser → Observation Service,HL7 ORU ➝ Observation JSON ➝ DB ➝ Notification/Event Bus,"Lab machines send structured results, like 'Blood Sugar = 120'. We convert this to a format the system understands (FHIR) and save it.",Lab ➝ [HL7 Parser] ➝ [Observation Service] ➝ [FHIR Observation DB]
