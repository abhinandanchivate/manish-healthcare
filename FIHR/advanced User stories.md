### 🧬 **HL7 Parser & Transformer**

**Persona: HL7 Integration Engineer / Backend System**

1. 🔄 As a **HL7 Gateway**, I want to **ingest real-time HL7 ADT messages via TCP**, persist the raw message, and emit events for parsing so that I don’t lose any data even in partial failure scenarios.
2. 🛠️ As a **Developer**, I want to **automatically detect the HL7 message type** (`ADT^A01`, `ORU^R01`) and **route to the correct transformer pipeline**, enabling flexible, multi-standard interoperability.
3. 🧾 As a **Compliance Auditor**, I want to **track original HL7 payload**, transformation logs, and the resulting FHIR resource version for traceability during audits.
4. 🔁 As a **System**, I want to support **batch HL7 messages** (e.g., Lab results for multiple patients) and handle partial success gracefully.
5. 🔍 As a **Validator**, I want to **verify mandatory segments and code systems** (e.g., ICD10, LOINC) are present before transforming to FHIR, ensuring clinical integrity.

### 🧍 **Patient Service (FHIR)**

**Persona: Patient / Doctor / External FHIR System**

6. 🗂️ As a **Doctor**, I want to **merge two patient records** with different MRNs but identical demographic and insurance data, while keeping audit history.
7. 🔁 As a **FHIR Consumer**, I want to use `$everything` operation to retrieve **all resources linked to a patient** (Encounters, Observations, Medications, etc.) as a single bundle.
8. 🔐 As an **Admin**, I want to enforce **fine-grained field-level visibility** (e.g., hide insurance info from Nurses but show to Admins).
9. 🚫 As a **System**, I want to **auto-expire inactive patient records** after a retention period, but retain anonymized analytics attributes.
10. 🌍 As a **Cross-Border EHR**, I want to map local patient ID to **national health identifier (NDHM / NHS)** for unified health records.

### 📊 **Observation Service (FHIR Observation / Lab Results)**

**Persona: Doctor / AI System / Lab Integration**

11. 🔬 As a **Doctor**, I want to **correlate lab results over time**, trigger alerts for abnormal patterns, and annotate suspicious trends (e.g., increasing creatinine).
12. 🧪 As a **Lab Device**, I want to **stream observations in HL7 v2 format**, which are transformed and **linked automatically to corresponding orders** in the system.
13. 🧠 As an **AI Engine**, I want to **predict lab result abnormalities using trend + diagnosis** (e.g., blood sugar prediction based on comorbidities and medication).
14. 🔍 As a **Researcher**, I want to query anonymized observation datasets for a specific cohort (e.g., female, age > 50, high cholesterol).
15. 🛡️ As a **Security Engine**, I want to **flag manual edits** to lab results made after verification and alert Admin.

### 📅 **Appointment Service**

**Persona: Patient / Scheduler / Doctor**

16. 🔁 As a **Scheduler**, I want to implement **double booking rules** (e.g., allow two patients in same slot if second is telemedicine), reducing missed time.
17. 🕑 As a **Doctor**, I want to view **average no-show rate per slot** and allow **dynamic overbooking suggestions**.
18. ⏳ As a **Patient**, I want to be placed in a **waitlist queue** if all preferred slots are full, and get notified when any slot opens up.
19. 🧾 As a **Billing Engine**, I want to **link completed appointments to billing codes** and expose API for insurance processing.
20. 📆 As a **System**, I want to auto-cancel unpaid appointments after `X` hours and notify patient with payment link.

### 🔐 **User Auth & RBAC**

**Persona: Developer / Security Analyst / Admin**

21. 🔐 As a **Security Officer**, I want to enforce **multi-tenant isolation**, so no data crosses from one hospital to another.
22. 🛡️ As a **System**, I want to **log JWT claims and role scope** with each request for audit trails.
23. 🧠 As a **DevOps**, I want token rotation support and refresh token expiry based on role sensitivity (e.g., shorter for Admins).
24. 🔑 As an **Admin**, I want to **suspend login access temporarily** for security review without deleting the user account.
25. 👥 As a **Role Manager**, I want to allow **temporary elevated permissions** (like Doctor viewing full notes) with expiry.

28. 📄 As a **System**, I want to **store consent acknowledgement with timestamp** before initiating any telemedicine call.
29. 🔍 As an **Admin**, I want to track **call quality metrics and completion rate** by region.
30. ⛔ As a **Security Officer**, I want to **expire session links** if reused, and restrict reuse by IP/device fingerprint.

### 📈 **Analytics + AI/ML**

**Persona: Data Scientist / Doctor / Health Authority**

31. 🤖 As an **AI Model**, I want access to **FHIR-compliant datasets filtered by consent**, ensuring data governance.
32. 📊 As a **Health Authority**, I want to **monitor patient readmission rates**, hospitalization trends, and alert anomalies.
